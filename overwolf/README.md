##Install

The compiled version is dist.zip in /Files

If you want to compile from source, from the Files directory run:
* npm install (if the first time)
* gulp (if already ran npm install previously)

##TODOs

* Get a code review
* Don't hardcode line separator?
* Bug: Don't re-upload a game when exiting / launching HS back again
